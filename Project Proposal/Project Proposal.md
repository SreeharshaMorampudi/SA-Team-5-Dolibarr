# Project Proposal - Dolibarr
## Hypothetical Operational Environment
Dolibarr ERP & CRM is a modular software of business management that adapts to the size of your company (SME, Large companies, Freelancers or associations)
It's an OpenSource project built by the addition of modules (you only enable the features you need), on a WAMP, MAMP, or LAMP server (Apache, Mysql, PHP for all Operating Systems).

## Team Motivation
We were searching for a project which matches our skillset and has more scope for improving the security so that it would be easy for us to work together and make a good contribution to the project.
Initially, we have finalized an open-source project that has less number of users who will be impacted if there is any potential security breach.
Later after taking some valuable inputs from Professor Gandhi, we decided to go with a project that has a wide number of users and more scope to improve security.
Our team members have experience in working with the development of CRM applications and PHP applications. 
So we have decided to work on this project.

## Project Description
Freelance professionals, foundations, and small businesses looking for CRM and ERP software to help with their business needs might find that Dolibarr is the tool for them. This combined CRM and ERP software allow users to organize and manage different facets of their business like communications, inventory management, orders, contacts, invoice management, and more. Dolibarr can be modified to fit the needs and requirements of the userâ€™s business since it is an open-source platform. Installation, usage, and custom development can be done. Dolibarr users can start using the software with the features that come with it, but as their business needs change they can have more features added on a LAMP, MAMP, or WAMP server (PHP, Mysql, Apache for all Operating Systems).

## Teamwork & Issues
As we are connecting remotely, we have faced some issues in coordinating initially. But after the team check-in the meeting we figured it out by creating a channel in teams to communicate.
We found it difficult to finalize an open-source project from GitHub which matches all our skills and interests and has a scope to contribute to the security of the project. 
After many discussions, we have finalized Dolibarr for our term project. We have weekly meetings to check up on the updates and completed the tasks on time. 
Going forward, we would continue to do the same by being honest and completing all the individual tasks assigned and helping each other in completing this project.
